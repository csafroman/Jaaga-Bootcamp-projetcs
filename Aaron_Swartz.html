							<h1 id="article-title">The boy who could have changed the world</h1>
							<p>
							<strong class="first-letter-of-article">A</strong>t 26 years old, Aaron Swartz had established himself as a singular force bridging the worlds of technology and activism – a young man driven by a restless curiosity and the belief that information was the most valuable of currencies, a form of wealth no one should be deprived of. As a teen programming prodigy, he had helped to develop RSS, the now-ubiquitous tool allowing users to self-syndicate information online, and at 19 he was one of the builders of <a class="in-article" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/"><strong>Reddit</strong></a>, the social news site that was purchased by Condé Nast, which turned Swartz into a millionaire before he could legally order a beer. Since then he had become a tireless and innovative advocate for a number of causes related to politics and the power of unfettered connectivity. In 2011, for instance, he successfully led a campaign to prevent the Stop Online Piracy Act (<a class="in-article" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act"><strong><abbr title="Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</abbr></strong></a>), a bill introduced to Congress that would have effectively legalized censorship on the Internet.
							</p>
							<p>
							Aaron taught himself how to read at the age of three and at a young age got interested in reading about the education system that exists in the world and possible alternatives to it, which taught him to question everything. As he grew older, one could see him becoming more and more interested in politics. And this too was predictable, for nobody with that razor-sharp intelligence could look at political system and not see the unfairness, hypocrisy and inequality that lies beneath it. So he morphed into the most technologically-gifted political activist in history. He looked for instances of manifest unfairness and developed software to remedy it. Discovering that the provision of court transcripts in the US was essentially a commercial racket, he teamed up with other activists to right an obvious wrong: that the law was only readable by those with money. He was similarly exercised at the fruits of taypayer-funded scientific research being monetised by a few ruthless publishing firms which charge outrageous fees to access the resulting academic papers. His first foray into this field involved downloading a trove of medical research papers and then data-mining them to uncover hitherto-undetected links between pharmaceutical firms and the authors of articles in prestigious journals.
							</p>
							<p>
							His downfall came when he turned his attention to <a class="in-article" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSTOR"><strong>JSTOR</strong></a>, a digital library of academic articles hidden behind a paywall. He devised a method of downloading large numbers of articles from JSTOR, using a computer hidden in a closet at MIT. He was <a class="in-article" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Swartz"><strong>arrested</strong></a> in January 2011 and pursued by federal prosecutors with a vindictive zeal, eventually being indicted on a raft of charges which carried a potential jail sentence of 35 years. Ground down by this, he hanged himself on 11 January 2013. News of his death left countless people saddened and enraged. What had made the Feds so vindictive? Sure, he had broken the law. But it wasn’t as if he’d hacked a bank. What came to mind was Alexander Pope’s rhetorical question: Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?. “The act was harmless” wrote Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia. “There was no actual physical harm, nor actual economic harm. The leak was found and plugged; JSTOR suffered no actual economic loss. It did not press charges. Like a pie in the face, Swartz’s act was annoying to its victim but of no lasting consequence.”
							</p>
							<p>
							Since Swartz’s suicide, congressional investigations have been launched into the Justice Department's prosecution of Swartz, and a bill called "Aaron's Law" has been introduced to amend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to rein in such prosecution in the future.
